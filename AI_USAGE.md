# AI Usage Declaration

This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools (Google Gemini).

**Usage Scope:**
- **Code Structure:** The initial skeleton for the Pygame visualizer was generated using AI to ensure modularity.
- **Debugging:** AI was used to resolve coordinate system errors (row/col mismatch) in the grid interaction logic.
- **Documentation:** README templates and report outlines were drafted with AI assistance.

**Student Contribution:**
- Implemented the specific logic for algorithm comparison.
- Conducted the empirical experiments and analyzed the results.
- Verified and tested the final software integrity.
